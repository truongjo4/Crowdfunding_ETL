# Crowdfunding_ETL

This mini-project involves simulating an ETL process. A dataset was cleaned and processed before being uploaded into a database (PostgreSQL).

## File Structure:

1. ETL_Mini_Project script contains the main script used during the data cleaning process.
2. ERD folder contains both an ERD diagram and the script to create it on QuickDBD.
3. Resources contains the base dataset (both xlsx files - contacts/crowdfunding) and the resulting four csv files to be loaded onto the database.

4. Schema contains two SQL scripts:

- schema -> the script used to create the tables
- verification -> the script to verify the tables and data have been created and imported correctly.
